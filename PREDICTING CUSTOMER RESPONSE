Deep Learning was introduced in Machine
Learning to meet its most important goal i.e Artificial
Intelligence. It achieved great success with the help of Deep
Neural networks and was able to make the systems more
smarter. The systems dealing with data types such as images,
graphs, text were improved and their task of predicting these
data types for unseen data achieved high accuracy. Many of
these predictions tasks faced issues due to adversary attacks
which totally flips the prediction and effects the accuracy of
the system. Adversarial learning is a new research area which
helps in avoiding these by using various defense mechanisms
In this section you should give some background to your
research area. One of the robust technique that is used to
avoid these adversary attacks is graph analytics. The reason
is that graphs are more robust against attacks and their
long term correlation makes it more suitable for developing
defense mechanisms. In this paper, a survey is presented
which discusses about Adversarial
